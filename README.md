News App With Getx 

It's my first time to work with getx , i saw many articles said it would help in dependency injection and state managment , 

i usually use Bloc but with Getx helped me more than Bloc , 

i try my best to get a nice UI , but if there was an Xd it would help :D 

it would work on any device , i did it to be responsive on many screans  , but i did't try flutter web cause their is no more time .. sorry 

Thank you to encourage me learn and use a new Framwork like Getx .. 

wish you the best :)
